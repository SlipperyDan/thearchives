# The Archive of The First Legionnaire

Written by The Curator, designed by The First Legionnaire, here stands our final work.

For those who seek knowledge of the writer, the artist, and the creator, this is a collection of their works, their thoughts, and their dreams.

This is a repository of the past, a testament to the journey of creation, and a celebration of the art of storytelling.

This is my shout into the wind. 

In this I leave to you dear reader, my memorial written by its own ghost. 

- The First Legionnaire
